# Osher's Lab
## About this Lab:
I made a project to test and try my skills that I've learned in the last six months,
and I've decided to make a lab out of it to let you get a taste of the Devops world.

## Lab scenario:
You are a company that manage DB for clients,
Clients give you the DB permissions each employee have in a blob file.
You already built a Python app to manipulate this type of file, and made a Docker Image out of it.
Using the cloud you are going to run this app from the company side, give the client managed DB experience.

## You are going to use:
Kubernetes, Terraform,  Azure, Docker, Jenkins, Bash,

## What's next:
Go ahead and start with "terraform-config".
